# Shape Calculator - Area, Perimeter & Volume Calculation

##About
This **Java-based Menu-Driven Program** calculates the **Area, Perimeter, Surface Area, and Volume** of different shapes based on user input.  
It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** using **abstract classes, interfaces, and method overriding.**  

---

## Features
- Supports both **2D and 3D Shapes**  
- Uses **Abstract Classes (`Shape`) and Interfaces (`Volume`)**  
- **Menu-driven UI** for easy selection  
- **Handles user inputs dynamically**  
- **Implements OOP best practices (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)**

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following Java files:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `Main.java` | Contains the main menu and handles user inputs |
| `Shape.java` | Abstract class for common shape properties and methods |
| `Volume.java` | Interface for volume calculation (implemented by 3D shapes) |
| `Circle.java` | Defines properties and methods for a **Circle** |
| `Rectangle.java` | Defines properties and methods for a **Rectangle** |
| `Square.java` | Defines properties and methods for a **Square** |
| `Sphere.java` | Defines properties and methods for a **Sphere** |
| `Cylinder.java` | Defines properties and methods for a **Cylinder** |
| `EquilateralPyramid.java` | Defines properties and methods for an **Equilateral Pyramid** |
